# Deploying Laravel w/ scheduler + queues on Sevalla

Sevalla works with Docker. Therefore, this repository includes a [Dockerfile](/Dockerfile) that packages a Laravel application and runs it.

## Architecture

On Sevalla, every app has a **default web process** that serves HTTP requests. In this example, the app is built from the repository’s `Dockerfile`, and the web process runs three services:

- **PHP-FPM**: runs your PHP application.
- **Nginx**: listens on `localhost:8080` and serves your Laravel app.
 - **Reverb**: WebSocket server on `localhost:8000`, proxied by Nginx under `/app`.

All services are managed by **supervisord**. The default start commands are in [entrypoint.sh](/entrypoint.sh).

## Steps

### 1. Prepare your repository

Copy this repository’s `Dockerfile` and `entrypoint.sh` files into the **root** of your Laravel project. Or just clone this repository if you are starting from scratch.

### 2. Create Sevalla resources

1. [Create a **database**](https://app.sevalla.com/databases).

2. [Create a **new application**](https://app.sevalla.com/apps/new) and connect your repository (don't deploy it yet).

### 3. Configure the Sevalla app

#### A. Create a process to run DB migrations

1. Go to **App → Processes** and create a **Job** process.
2. Set the start command to:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --force
   ```

#### B. Allow internal connections between the app and database

1. Go to **App → Networking** and scroll to **Connected services**.
2. Click **Add connection**, select the database you created, and enable **Add environment variables to the application** in the modal.

#### C. Set environment variables

Set the following in **App → Environment variables**. Fill in any empty values for your setup.

**Notes:**
- Set `DB_CONNECTION` with the value matching the database you created in step **B**. E.g., `mysql` or `pgsql`.
- `DB_URL` is automatically added if you completed step **B**.
- **Set `APP_URL` and `ASSET_URL` to your Sevalla app URL (e.g., `https://your-app.sevalla.app` or your custom domain).**
- Ensure `APP_KEY` is set (e.g., via `php artisan key:generate`).
- In production, keep `APP_DEBUG` to `false`.
- Set `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=reverb`.
- Set `REVERB_APP_ID`, `REVERB_APP_KEY`, and `REVERB_APP_SECRET` (random values are fine).
- Set `REVERB_HOST` to your app web process private hostname, `REVERB_PORT=8000`, and `REVERB_SCHEME=http`.
- Set `VITE_REVERB_APP_KEY=${REVERB_APP_KEY}`, `VITE_REVERB_HOST` to your public host (no protocol), and `VITE_REVERB_SCHEME=https`.
- If workers need to reach Reverb, expose private port `8000` in **App → Networking**.

#### D. Start the scheduler

1. Go to **App → Processes → Create process → Background worker**.
2. Set the custom start command to `php artisan schedule:work`.

#### E. Start your default queue

1. Go to **App → Processes → Create process → Background worker**.
2. Set the custom start command to `php artisan queue:work`.

#### F. Switch to Dockerfile-based build

Go to **App → Settings → Build** and change **Build environment** to **Dockerfile**.

### 4. Deploy 🚀

Trigger a new deployment from Sevalla. Once deployed, your Laravel app, Nginx, and Reverb will run inside the web process under supervisord.
